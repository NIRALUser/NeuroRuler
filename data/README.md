# README

If this directory name changes, it needs to change in user_settings.py and constants.py and in .github/workflows/tests.yml.

Note: All .nrrd, .nii.gz, .nii, and .tsv files in this directory are ignored.

Data is downloaded here during GitHub CI tests. See .github/workflows/tests.yml.

Feel free to put data here locally, but don't commit it to GitHub.
